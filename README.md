# PDF Renamer

A python tool to extract a title from a pdf and set the file name and pdf title to this

## Problem

I have some pdfs with nonsense filenames and inconsistent titles. I want to add these files to my ereader, but it will make them hard to navigate.

## Solution

This tool extracts title information from the PDFs and then renames the file and title with that title.
